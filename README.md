# RenameMultipleFilesExtension
Rename the file extension of all target file types in a directory

The overall idea of what this project does is to provide a command line tool for renaming the file extension of
all target file types in a directory(including subdirectories). It aims to eliminate the painstaking task of having 
to rename the file extension of a lot of files.
